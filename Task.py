'''Each task should be done'''
''' 
    Note that the tasks are assumed to be done in a sequential manner, they will be done one by one. Our process is that
    after each execution is done, we check if its done successfully. If so, then next execution; otherwise raise an error.
    We give each execution three chances, if it could be finished in three times.
